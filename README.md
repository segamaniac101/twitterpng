# twitterpng

Python 3 scripts designed to download high quality pngs from Twitter.

# How to use
**Please note that you'll need wget installed via pip and the urllib version is not working as of yet**

Simply type in either 'python3 twitterpng-wget.py' or 'python3 twitterpng-urllib.py', then enter a valid 'pbs.twimg.com' url, such as 'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FemtknYXoAAQKh8'. **MAKE SURE YOU REMOVE THE '?' AND THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS OR ELSE IT WON'T WORK!** After you input the url, you should be able to see the downloaded image in the same directory as the script's.
